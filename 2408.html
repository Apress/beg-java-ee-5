		<p>The version of JBoss reccommended for installation is 4.0.3.  Unfortunately the EJB implementation provided by JBoss was not officially included in the ZIP
		file distribution due to the EJB3 specification not being finalized.  Users who have not yet downloaded JBoss or wish to try the JBoss Application Server installer
		may visit the following link http://www.jboss.com/products/jbossas/downloads and click on the "Run Installer" link for the latest version of JBoss.
		</p>
		<p>The installer will download the specified version of JBoss to your computer and prompt you for the installation location and server profile.  When the list of server profiles appear,
		select "EJB3" and continue the installation.  The remaining values suggested by the installer do not require any alteration to run the example code; the only change
		required on your part will be to start JBoss only using the run.bat.  You should not specify the "all" configuration when starting JBoss if you have installed it
		using the installer. JBoss will then be installed on your computer.</p>
		<p>Users may also download the JBoss EJB3 implementation separate from the JBoss server package (in order to add EJB3 functionality to a ZIP package install of JBoss as described
		in the book) by visiting the URL http://www.jboss.com/products/list/downloads#ejb3 and downloading the latest release candidate (At the time of errata submission, the EJB3
		implementation is at RC3). The zip file includes an HTML document which outlines the installation procedure.  Summarized, the procedure is as follows:</p>
	<p>
		* Unzip the EJB3 package<br/>
		* Copy the lib\ejb3.deployer directory to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy<br/>
		* Copy the lib\ejb3-clustered-sfsbcache-service.xml to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy<br/>
		* Copy the lib\ejb3-entity-cache-service.xml to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy<br/>
		* Copy the lib\ejb3-interceptors-aop.xml to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy<br/>
		* Copy the lib\jboss-aop-jdk50.deployer directory to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy<br/>
		* Copy the lib\jboss-xb.jar to &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\lib<br/>
		* If you are using a version of JBoss prior to 4.0.3, remove the directory &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy\jboss-hibernate.deployer<br/>
		* Remove the directory &lt;jboss directory&gt;\server\all\deploy\jboss-aop.deployer<br/>
		<br/>
		EJB3 should now be installed in the "All" server configuration.  As discussed in the book, make certain to start the server with the "all" configuration
		via the command "&lt;jboss directory&gt;\bin\run -c all".

<pre>
	private @Resource(name="ConnectionFactory")
	  ConnectionFactory factory;
	private @Resource(name="queue/LogWriter")
	  Queue queue;
</pre> <br/>
should read:<br/>
<pre>
	private @Resource(mappedName="java:/ConnectionFactory")
	  ConnectionFactory factory;
	private @Resource(mappedName="queue/LogWriter")
	  Queue queue;
</pre><br/>
to reflect changes in how JNDI paths are now recognized by the @Resource directive in EJB3.  Using the mappedName
parameter will specify that the value passed is a JNDI path.

		The paragraph that reads:

<br/>
<pre>
     private @Resource(name="ConnectionFactory")
     ConnectionFactory factory;
     private @Resource(name="queue/LogWriter")
     Queue queue;
</pre>
The name directive being passed to the @Resource annotation is instructing the container that it should populate the variable
in question (factory or queue) with a reference to the instance that the container recognizes by that name. Remember the XML
deployment file timer-message-service.xml? That particular file instructed the JMS subsystem to create a queue named (not at all
coincidentally) queue/LogWriter. Here that JNDI name is referenced by the @Resource annotation to acquire it, where it is
subsequently used by timeoutHandler(Timer timer)
<br/>
		should instead read:
<br/>
<pre>
     private @Resource(mappedName="java:/ConnectionFactory")
     ConnectionFactory factory;
     private @Resource(mappedName="queue/LogWriter")
     Queue queue;
</pre><br/>
The mappedName directive being passed to the @Resource annotation is instructing the container that it should populate the variable
in question (factory or queue) with a reference to the instance that the container recognizes as "mapped" via JNDI to that name. Remember
the XML deployment file timer-message-service.xml? That particular file instructed the JMS subsystem to create a queue named in JNDI as (not at all
coincidentally) queue/LogWriter. Here that JNDI name is referenced by the @Resource annotation to acquire it, where it is
subsequently used by timeoutHandler(Timer timer)
